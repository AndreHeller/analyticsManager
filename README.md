# Angular Template Project

Requires Nodejs, gulp and tsd installed globally on your machine.

Just three steps:

* Clone repo, copy it somewhere else and connect to another or whatever.
* Open console. Go to Assets folder and type "npm install" and after that "tsd reinstall".
* Create something new!
